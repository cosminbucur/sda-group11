### java-advanced
1. use drawio (https://www.draw.io/) and create "building blocks" with concepts for the following topics

        git
        testing

2. read about UML 2 (unified modeling language) 
        
     https://sparxsystems.com/resources/tutorials/uml2/class-diagram.html

3. create a UML class diagram for each of the following concepts

        composition (HAS-A)
        aggregation	(HAS-A)
        inheritance (IS-A)
        encapsulation
        abstract classes
        interfaces
        
4. write code to prove the concepts in the UML diagrams using the guidelines:

- use encapsulation (private fields, getters + setters)
- use aggregation (use )
- use inheritance (create at least 2 levels of inheritance, eg: Grandparent, Parent, Child)
- use default constructor and constructor with multiple parameters
- use "this" keyword in methods
- use "super" keyword in constructor and methods
- extract common methods in an abstract class (extend it with at least 2 classes)
- define an interface (implement it in at least 2 classes)
- create a class that extends an abstract class and implements 2 interfaces3
